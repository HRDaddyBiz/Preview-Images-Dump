### 💼 MISSION

You are watermarking all provided **preview images** with a visible, non-removable HR Daddy™ watermark. These previews will be used on **stripe product listings** and **HRDaddy.biz product pages**. The watermark should **blend stylishly** but remain **clearly visible** and **discourage unauthorized reuse**.

### ✅ WATERMARKING INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Watermark Text**:
   `HR Daddy™ — Protected Creative Content`

2. **Placement**:
   Bottom-right corner OR diagonally across the image (you decide based on design visibility). It must:

   * Be visible but not obstruct key design
   * Blend professionally with the aesthetic (semi-transparent, elegant serif/sans font)
   * Avoid appearing removable or overly subtle

3. **Styling**:

   * Font: Use **Cormorant Garamond** or **Montserrat** if available
   * Size: Proportional to image (not too small)
   * Opacity: \~60–70% so it's visible but sleek
   * No emojis, stickers, or decorative effects

4. **Final Export Settings**:

   * Format: `.png`
   * Dimensions: Minimum **1200px width**, max 1600px width
   * Aspect Ratio: \~16:9 or square (Stripe accepts 1200x800 or 1200x1200)
   * File Naming: Match the product title with dashes (e.g. `back-pay-bitch-preview.png`)

### 🚫 LIABILITY & EMOJI PREVENTION

* Do **not** include emojis, informal symbols, or suggestive imagery in the watermark or file.
* Do **not** promise any specific outcomes or product claims.
* Do **not** include branding language like "guaranteed" or performance stats in the image text.
* Do **not** place watermark in a way that could suggest legal action or aggressive enforcement — just a stylish, visible warning.
